Palestine - All You Need To Know

The purpose of our app is to create an informal educational space to spark creativity and learning. Our app will have multiple educational pages, an about us section, a timeline with educational facts and dates. Our app will also include user interaction where they can post photos, reply to others, like posts, etc… We’d like to create a place for learning and expression for issues marginal communities deal with on the basis, such as the Palestinian cause.
